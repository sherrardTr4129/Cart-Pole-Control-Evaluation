# Cart Pole Control Methodology Evaluation
This repository contains two seperate implementations of a cart-pole control solution. The first is implemented in MATLAB using traditional state-space control techniques. The second method makes use of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) to learn the proper action policy using reinforcement learning techniques.
