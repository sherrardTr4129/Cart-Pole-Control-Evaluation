# Cart Pole Control Methodology Evaluation
This repository contains two seperate implementations of a cart-pole control solution. The first is implemented in MATLAB using traditional state-space control techniques. The second method makes use of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) to learn the proper action policy using reinforcement learning techniques.

## DQN Based Solution (Python3)

### Python Dependencies
All required python3 dependencies are enumerated in the requirements.txt file. You can run the following command in a terminal window to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r DQN_method/requirements.txt
```
